When you run this program, you will be brought to a start menu with a few different options.
When you start a new game (1), you will be prompted to enter your name, then you will be transported to a location, based on a map.
You will have to fight some enemies along the way, and your health will decrease if they hit you with their attack.
The game will autosave everytime you switch locations.
You have the freedom do go where ever you want and there is no set game path.
Have fun!
